🛒 Online Shopping Cart Abandonment Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes online shopping cart abandonment behavior using Python, Pandas, data visualization, and Machine Learning.
The goal is to understand why users abandon carts, identify category-wise trends, and analyze the effect of cart value on abandonment probability.

The project is built as part of Minor-1 (Pandas + ML) coursework.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze cart abandonment behavior
Study category-wise abandonment trends
Visualize abandonment using bar charts and heatmaps
Predict abandonment probability using Logistic Regression
Perform summary statistics on cart value
